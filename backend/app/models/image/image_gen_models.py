  Represents a single image, typically as a response from an Imagen API

      mime_type: The MIME type of the image (e.g., 'image/jpeg', 'image/png').
      signed_uri: A pre-signed URL for temporary public access to the GCS URI.
      gcs_fuse_path: The FUSE path if the GCS bucket is mounted locally.
      image_bytes: The raw bytes of the image, if available in memory.

                      "mask"). Uses `IMAGE_REFERENCE_TYPES` values.
      reference_subtype: A more specific classification within the type

      description: A text description providing more context for the reference

      mask_mode: For 'mask' references, specifies how the mask should be

      mask_dilation: For 'mask' references, an optional value to expand or
                     contract the mask area.
      segmentation_classes: For 'mask' references, a list of integer IDs
                            representing object classes to be masked.
