      aspect_ratio: The desired aspect ratio of the output image (e.g., "1:1",
                    "16:9"). Defaults to "1:1".

             (e.g., "imagen-3.0-generate-002").

      person_generation: Controls the generation of human figures
                         (e.g., "allow_adult", "block_all").
      safety_filter_level: The strictness of the safety filter applied
                           to generated content. Defaults to
                           `types.SafetyFilterLevel.BLOCK_ONLY_HIGH`.

                       the generated image.

                      the input prompt for better results. Defaults to `True`.
